            <strong>Hi!</strong> 
            I'm Thomas! I'm a junior programmer based in Swarthmore, PA. Some might say I <em>should</em> have a degree from that College by now, but <i>c&#39est la vie</i>, 
            and when in doubt, <strong>BLAME COVID</strong>. </p><p>Here's a picture of me!</p>

            Last week, I began working through <em>Automate the Boring Stuff</em> by Al Sweigart. I thought it would be a good book for me to work through in order to
            relearn coding - it's been probably 4 years since I've coded in any serious capacity. However, after completing two chapters, 
            I realized that I wanted to blog my process, but I didn't want to use Medium or a similar blogging site. I wanted the blog to be hosted 
            on my own, from-scratch website, along with links to my portfolio/projects. Of course, I had no idea how to do this. After extensive 
            "research", which should likely be renamed "browsing", I came accross The Odin Project. I liked its presentation style, and thought that it
             would be a good platform for me. Because it immediately threw me into learning, creating a dev environment, and learning strategies 
             ABOUT learning, I felt like it was different from many of the other <em>tutorial-esque</em> learning spaces I had seen before. So I decided to take the plunge,
             and I switched from learning Python to digging into the Foundations track of the Odin Project.
        </p>

        <p>
            Diving a bit into the curriculum so far, the course begins with an introduction, detailing the course itself, as well as various resources from which students
            can acquire additional help. This includes the Odin Project community on discord, and resources such as StackOverflow, reddit, and YouTube. I particularly liked 
            the <em>Motivation and Mindset</em> portion of the introduction section. I learned many valuable techniques and fundamentals of our brain structure, such as the 
            focused and diffused modes of the brain, and the <strong>Pomodoro technique</strong> for avoiding procrastination; the Tomato Timer desktop app has been invaluable
            in beginning my web development journey. Following a few days of mindset training, the course jumps right into setting up a coding environment using Ubuntu, VSCode, 
            and Google Chrome for testing. I will mention as a bit of a <strong>disclamer:</strong> I installed Linux using WSL2 and Windows Terminal Preview. If you would like to 
            do the same thing, you can do so <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">here</a>. However, please keep in mind that The Odin Project <strong><em>
            does not support native Windows or any version of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) as a development environment</em></strong>. This means that I may experience -
            and already have experienced - additional difficulties or questions within my dev-space that cannot be resolved through the Odin team, and that I must do <em>my own
            research</em>. So far, the only issue I have faced was setting up the Live Server extension on VSCode - unfortunately, due to not understanding Json files
             I had to switch my default browser back to Chrome.
 
        </p>
        <p>
            All in all, I am <strong><em>extremely</em></strong> excited to continue learning with the Odin Project. Of course, this site was written using the knowledge I have gained
            (regained?) so far in the program, and the introductory material has focused my mindset such that <strong>I even did extra work!</strong> I can probably credit
            <a href="https://www.toptal.com/project-managers/tomato-timer">Tomato Timer</a> for allowing me to give myself the time needed to create the best work that I can, given
            my highly limited knowledge of web development. I am super excited to continue with the program, and I hope to update a weekly blog (hopefully on a better/full site) 
            with my progress! Thanks for reading!
